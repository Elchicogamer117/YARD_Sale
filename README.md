# Yard Sale Shop
This project is part of a courses series where we build an online shop with Stack PERNN (PostgreSQL, Express.js, React.js, Node.js and Next.js). In this level we made the layout of a-shop, you can see that the HTML and CSS are in the same file, this is to facilitate its implementation at the next level.

The layout was based in [this design]( https://www.figma.com/file/uEwdrNpXbtPvz3rgXR5myN/YardSale?node-id=0%3A998) made in figma.

## Components and views
To next you can see the main components and its different views separately as well as their behavior in both version (desk and mobile)

### Nabvar

### Articles
One of the most important components in which each item fits the width of the available screen

### Complementary components
Finally, elements that don't belong in a full screen view and therefore don't require too much responsive design
